Uses StdDraw to create a variation of patterns. 

# Installation: 
This program utilizes the stdlib.jar library (provided in repository) for the use of StdDraw. Include this library in IDE or during command line execution.

#How to Print the Patterns
Once the library is included, you/user will have to enter a number from 0 - 3 in either the program arguments of your IDE or your command line. Each number will print a different pattern.
